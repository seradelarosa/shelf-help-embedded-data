In this lab you’ll create the Cookbook app, a dynamic pantry manager for cooking enthusiasts! For this exercise, you’ll be practicing embedding a new data schema within a user model. Users will have the power to perform full CRUD operations to manage their pantry items with ease. They’ll also have the opportunity to explore other users’ pantries, drawing inspiration and sharing their love for cooking.

MVP: Your task is to perform full crud on items in a User’s pantry - an embedded data schema on the user model.

Use the following user stories to guide the functionality and features of your application:

As a User (AAU), I want to sign up for an account and sign in, so that I can access my personal user profile and manage my pantry.
AAU, I want an easy and consistent way to navigate through the site, whether I am signed in or not. I need to quickly access options to sign up, sign in, view my pantry, or sign out, depending on my current status.
AAU, I need a dedicated page to view all items in my pantry, to easily manage and review what I have stored.
AAU, I want to easily find and click on an ‘Add New Item’ link, which takes me to a form for adding new items to my pantry
AAU, after filling out the pantry item form, I want to submit it and receive confirmation that the item has been saved in my pantry.
AAU, I need the ability to edit and delete items in my pantry, allowing me full control over managing my stored items.
AAU, I am interested in viewing a list of all other app users, to foster a sense of community and interaction within the app.
AAU, I want the option to click on another user’s profile and view all the items in their pantry, to exchange ideas or find inspiration for my own pantry.
